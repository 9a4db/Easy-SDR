# Assembly guide for HF Upconverter (TH) module

## Manufacture of inductors
In the process of manufacturing this module, you will have to manufacture the inductance coils yourself for the used input / output filters. Coils are made by winding an enameled copper wire of a certain diameter to a round workpiece of a certain diameter (it is convenient to use drills). Before winding the coil, clean one end of the wire from the insulation (use an aggressive solvent or insulation heating). Make windings as closer to each other. After finishing the winding of the coil, remove the protective insulation from the other end of the coil and tin both ends. After doing this, your coil will be ready for installation on the PCB.

Characteristics of coils for manufacturing:
- 39 nH - wire Ø0.5mm., coil Ø2.5mm., windings 4 - **3 pcs.**;
- 330 nH - wire Ø0.25mm., coil Ø2.5mm., windings 14 - **1 pcs.**;
- 390 nH - wire Ø0.25mm., coil Ø2.5mm., windings 16 - **1 pcs**;

## Components installing 
In the beginning, it is recommended to install self-made inductors, since soldering and manufacturing of these elements can cause difficulties if you doing this for the first time. Other passive components can be mounted in any convenient order for you.  
However, it is strongly recommended that you **use an antistatic wrist strap and do not use soldering irons that are powered directly from the 220V / 110V network**, which can damage the crystal oscillator and mixer when soldering.

Recommendations for assembling components:

- Soldering self-made inductors.
- Soldering other passive components in any order.
- Soldering the diode 1N4148.
- Soldering the power connector and the switch.
- Soldering of the mixer.
- Soldering the crystall oscillator.
- Soldering SMA connectors.
