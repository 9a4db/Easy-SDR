# HF Upconverter

HF Upconverter was based on the idea of an shifting the frequency up by a certain value (I use 125 MHz value), after this conversion your receiver will be able to correctly process frequencies below 30 MHz with less loss of useful signal. 

Easy and quick building of HF Upconverter at the [TH component group](./TH) or [SMD component group](./SMD/EasyEDA). Module includes schematic (EasyEDA) and PCB files (EasyEDA, Sprint layout). Based on the submitted files, you can independently manufacture a PCB or order its production at the factory. HF Upconverter was based on the idea of an shifting the frequency up by a certain value (I use 125 MHz value), after this conversion your receiver will be able to correctly process frequencies below 30 MHz with less loss of useful signal. In turn, I developed PCB for the independently manufacturing based on the existing circuit. As a result, the self-made manufacture of the upconverter is cheaper than buying a ready-made module.

## Current available implementations at EasyEDA platform:
- [HF Upconverter (TH)]
- [HF Upconverter (SMD)]
