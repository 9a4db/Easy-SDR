# Project for easy and quick building HF Upconverter

Project includes schematic and PCB (EasyEDA, Sprint layout). Based on the submitted files, you can independently manufacture a PCB or order its production at the factory. The project was based on the idea of an shifting the frequency up by a certain value (I use 125 MHz value), after this conversion your receiver will be able to correctly process frequencies below 30 MHz with less loss of useful signal. In turn, I developed PCB for the independently manufacturing based on the existing circuit. As a result, the self-made manufacture of the upconverter is cheaper than buying a ready-made module.
