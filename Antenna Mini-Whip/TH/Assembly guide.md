# Assembly guide for Antenna Mini-Whip (TH) module

This module does not have any specific recommendations for assembly. All passive components can be mounted in any convenient order for you.  
However, it is strongly recommended that you **use an antistatic wrist strap and do not use soldering irons that are powered directly from the 220V / 110V network**, which can damage the J310 field-effect transistor when soldering.

Recommendations for assembling components:

- Solder all passive components in any order.
- Solder the diode 1N5819.
- Soldering of the transistor 2N5109.
- Soldering the field effect transistor J310.
- Soldering SMA connectors.

**Please pay special attention to the grounding of the antenna**. If there is no ground, the antenna will not work properly.

A useful step can also be to check the output voltage level with a multimeter. To prevent damage to your receiver, connect PFU to the power supply, and perform voltage measurement on the SMA connector (PFU-to-receiver connector). The value of the output voltage must be zero. After that, you can make further connections and work with the antenna.
