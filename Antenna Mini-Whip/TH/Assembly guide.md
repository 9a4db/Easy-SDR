# Assembly guide for Antenna Mini-Whip (TH) module

This module does not have any specific recommendations for assembly. All passive components can be mounted in any convenient order for you.  
However, it is strongly recommended that you **use an antistatic wrist strap and do not use soldering irons that are powered directly from the 220V / 110V network**, which can damage the J310 field-effect transistor when soldering.

Recommendations for assembling components:
- Solder all passive components in any order.
- Solder the diode 1N5819.
- Soldering of the transistor 2N5109.
- Soldering the field effect transistor J310.
- Soldering SMA connectors.
