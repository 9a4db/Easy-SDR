# The project implements some hardware devices and software for cheap SDR receivers based on Realtek RTL2832U controller 

## What is SDR?
[Software-defined radio (SDR)] is a radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.

## What are the objectives of this project?
Creating affordable, easy-to-manufacture layouts of PCBs and software to working and expand the capabilities of existing low-cost SDR receivers available to ordinary users. All the created elements of the project will have a detailed description of the manufacturing process, with all the existing features and possible problems.

## Where can I buy a SDR receiver?
You can order the SDR receiver on any of the currently available internet sites, such as Ebay, Aliexpress, Taobao, etc. Or you can use the following links to order some advanced versions of SDR receivers:

| SDR Store | Information |
| ----- | ----- |
| [RTL-SDR.COM] | International shipping. Performed selling modified versions of receivers. Performs support and develop new versions. |
