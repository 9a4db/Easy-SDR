# Manufacture of a PCB in home conditions by the LUT method.

The method of manufacturing a PCB using the LUT method is performs by printing a workpiece of PCB at a laser printer with using photo paper. After that, the image of the resulting blank is transferred to the copper clad board. The next step is etching the printed circuit board and preparing the mounting holes. Further, tinning of PCB is carried out and a layer of solder mask and silkscreen are applied. Instead of a solder mask, it is possible to apply a protective varnish.

## To manufacture a PCB for this technology, you will need:

- [Single-layer copper clad board](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XCopper+Clad.TRS0&_nkw=Copper+Clad&_sacat=0) which corresponding size of the designed PCB;
- Tool for trimming the PCB workpiece;
- Fine grained [sandpaper](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xsandpaper.TRS0&_nkw=sandpaper&_sacat=0);
- [Glossy photo paper](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.A0.H0.XGlossy+photo+paper.TRS5&_nkw=Glossy+photo+paper&_sacat=0). Its size should be greater than or equal to the manufactured PCB;
- Flatiron;
- Degreaser or solvent;
- Plastic or glass container for etching PCB.;
- Hydrogen peroxide, 3% solution, 100 ml.;
- Citric acid, 30 g.;
- Table salt, 5 g.;
- [Drill machine for drilling holes](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xdremel.TRS0&_nkw=dremel&_sacat=0);
- Drills, diameter [0.6 mm.](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xdrill+0.6mm.TRS2&_nkw=drill+0.6mm&_sacat=0) and [1 mm.](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.A0.H0.Xdrill+1mm.TRS5&_nkw=drill+1mm&_sacat=0);
